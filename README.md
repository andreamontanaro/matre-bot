# MatreBot for Discord!

This is a simple NodeJS program created to learn how Discord bot development works. It will be implemented with command for memes, audios and more activities, such as image manipulation and maybe minigames.

## Built in Types!

This project and the Discord.js library is written in TypeScript so all commands and Discord's API have strong typization for a better programming and refactoring experience.
